This software bridges the gap between the simplicity of text-based communication and the complexity of today‚Äôs social media platforms. My journey began with a quest to rediscover the roots of online communication, from the firsthand use of a BBS to setting one up. Let‚Äôs explore what makes Mystic BBS stand out in an era dominated by graphical user interfaces and why it‚Äôs still relevant (or not) for users today.\nKey Features\nMystic BBS distinguishes itself with features that are a breath of fresh air in today‚Äôs ad-driven internet landscape:\n\nPure Text Experience: Embrace the clarity and simplicity of plain text.\nPrivacy-Focused: No bots, trackers, or intrusive analytics.\nAd-Free Environment: Enjoy content without distractions.\n\nSetup and Configuration\nGetting Mystic BBS up and running on an Ubuntu LXC container was straightforward. The process, detailed on their installation guide, involved downloading the package, following simple instructions, and configuring firewall rules. My goal was to dive into the BBS experience with minimal fuss, focusing on the essence of communication over customization, so this review will not go into detail on this.\nPerformance\nMystic BBS is impressively lightweight, capable of running on anything from a modern server to a vintage 486 laptop. This flexibility demonstrates its efficiency and the low barrier to entry in terms of hardware requirements.\nSoftware and User Experience\nThe true test came with posting a message. Despite the simplicity of text-based interaction, the challenge lies in introducing contemporary users to Telnet or SSH‚Äîtechnologies far removed from today‚Äôs intuitive graphical interfaces. The process, while straightforward to the tech-savvy, poses a significant hurdle to less technical users, underscoring a gap between the ease of use and accessibility.\nPros and Cons\nPros:\n\nFree and Open Source.\nSimple setup with minimal hardware requirements.\nPrivacy-focused and ad-free.\n\nCons:\n\nNot user-friendly for those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces or older technologies.\n\nConclusion and Rating\nMysticBBS stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of BBS systems, offering a niche platform for enthusiasts of retro computing and privacy-conscious users. While it excels in simplicity and privacy, its accessibility barriers limit its appeal to a broader audience. MysticBBS is a niche haven for the tech-savvy elite, reminiscent of communities like Arch Linux and DWM users. For the general public, however, its complexities make it less recommendable.\nRating: üåüüåü (2/5 Stars)\nFor its targeted audience, MysticBBS is unparalleled; for the mainstream, it remains a curiosity."},"Forgiving-Sin":{"title":"Forgiving Sin","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"John 20:21-23 (KJV)\n21 Then said Jesus to them again,  Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.\n22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them,  Receive ye the Holy Ghost:\n23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained."},"Idaho-SB1291--and--SB1317":{"title":"Idaho SB1291 & SB1317","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The problem with this approach is that it is a double-edged sword that is being wielded by a 900 lbs gorilla.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uahVZP-tSQw&amp;t=298s\nhttps://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/S1291.pdf\nhttps://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/S1317.pdf\nResources:\n"},"Jury-Nullification":{"title":"Jury Nullification","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"News-Sites":{"title":"News Sites","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Sites I visit for news and information.

As such the world of Protestantism has plenty to say on the matter. One such comment on the matter is below.\n\nSomeone commented this on the post above:\nBaptism Means nothing if He has not placed his faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ and repented of his sins. If he has, then praise God. I love Russell Brand, one of the smartest and funniest guys out there.\nFriend, you have this backwards.\nJames 2:14:\nWhat shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?\nJames 2:15:\nAnd if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:\nJames 2:16:\nAnd one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?\nJames 2:17:\nSo faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.\nIf you are a Bible believing Christian like me, then you have to realize that what our friend professed to believe is not what the Bible teaches.\nAnd then there was this comment:\nWater does not wash away our sins. the blood of Jesus alone does that.\nAnd then later this:\nI am a Bible believing Christian. If you say baptism can wash away sin then why would Almighty God send his Son to die? Please. You are taking scripture out of context. The thief on the cross was not baptized. I encourage baptism but to say it is necessary for salvation takes away from what Jesus did on the cross.\nLet‚Äôs take on the the first objection that water does not wash away our sins.\nTwo requirements - REPENT &amp; BAPTISM\nActs 2:38:\nBut Peter said to them: Do (REPENT) penance: and be (BAPTISM) baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nActs 8:26:\nNow an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.\nActs 8:27:\nAnd rising up, he went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.\nActs 8:28:\nAnd he was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading Isaias the prophet.\nActs 8:29:\nAnd the Spirit said to Philip: Go near and join thyself to this chariot.\nActs 8:30:\nAnd Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?\nActs 8:31:\nWho said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.\nActs 8:32:\nAnd the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter: and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.\nActs 8:33:\nIn humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?\nActs 8:34:\nAnd the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? Of himself, or of some other man?\nWITNESS 1st\nPhillip tells the eunuch about Christ (from the Old Testament).\nActs 8:35:\nThen Philip, opening his mouth and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.\nActs 8:36:\nAnd as they went on their way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said: See, here is water: What doth hinder me from being baptized?\nAsks if he believes, 2nd\nActs 8:37:\nAnd Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\nWater Baptism, 3rd\nActs 8:38:\nAnd he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch. And he baptized him.\nActs 8:39:\nAnd when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip: and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.\nBAPTISM WASHES AWAY SIN\nActs 22:16:\nAnd now why tarriest thou? Rise up and be baptized and wash away thy sins, invoking his name.\nActs shows us that there is more than one thing required for salvation.\n\nWitness and acceptance. Phillip witnesses to the eunuch. The eunuch hears and accepts.\nThe eunuch is Baptized.\nOur sins are in fact washed away by baptism.\n\nWhat did not happen?\nAfter the eunuch believed what Phillip witnessed to him, Phillip did not say ‚ÄúWell you are saved because you believed‚Äù. He also did not say ‚ÄúStop the chariot and pray the sinners prayer with me‚Äù.\nThere were two works that needed to be done. He had to believe and then be baptized. And note that Phillip put a qualifier on baptism. Phillip says ‚ÄúIF you believe with all your heart‚Äù, so baptism is conditional too. It‚Äôs not good enough to say you believe, you have to do so with all your heart.\nRomans 6: 3 Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death?\n4 For we are buried together with him by baptism into death: that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.\nTake note that Paul doesn‚Äôt say, you are saved because you believe. He does however say explicitly that a work - baptism - is what causes us to have a new life.\nYou are positively not saved by faith alone and those espousing that are not Bible believing Christians because clearly the Bible does not teach that. Faith is a necessary requirement but is not the only requirement.\nThe Thief on The Cross Objection\nIf you are before Jesus and He forgives you, because He is God The Father, God The Son, and God The Holy Spirit, then there is nothing more needed. During the Mass we say ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.‚Äù Matthew 8:8 Christ has that power, no one else. So unless you were forgiven directly by Christ, you should get baptized with water.\nMark 16:15-16\n15 And he said unto them,  Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\n16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."},"What-an-AG-Veto-would-do":{"title":"What an AG Veto would do","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"about":{"title":"About","links":["Books","King-James-Bible","privacy"],"tags":[],"content":"My name is Norman Bauer.\nI have many interests such as my wife &amp; our kids (2 girls), outdoors stuff, canning, long term food storage, cryptocurrency, precious metals, Austrian Economics, libertarianism, agorism, the US Constitution, electronics, programming, computer repair, virtualization, Linux, Linux Containers, networking, Books, UFO‚Äôs, music, radio‚Äôs (CB, AM, Shortwave, and some HAM stuff too), King James Bible,Catholicism, Christian Apologetics, The Early Church Fathers, and a lot more.

They are in charge of reporting on the money supply.\nOn March 16, 2020 the M2 stock was 15,726 billion USD.\nAs of July 27th, 2020 the M2 stock was 18286 billion USD.\nThat represents a 14% increase in the money supply in a matter of 4 months.\n\nREAL INFLATION = 25.14% from 04/16/20 - 02/01/21\n\n\nWhat is M- Stock?\nIn banking the supply of money and credit is broken down into three catagories.\nM1\n\nM1 includes funds that are readily accessible for spending. M1 consists  of: (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and  the vaults of depository institutions; (2) traveler‚Äôs checks of nonbank  issuers; (3) demand deposits; and (4) other checkable deposits (OCDs),  which consist primarily of negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts at depository institutions and credit union share draft accounts.  Seasonally adjusted M1 is calculated by summing currency, traveler‚Äôs  checks, demand deposits, and OCDs, each seasonally adjusted separately.\n\nM2\n\nM2 includes a broader set of financial assets held principally by  households. M2 consists of M1 plus: (1) savings deposits (which include  money market deposit accounts, or MMDAs); (2) small-denomination time  deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000); and (3)  balances in retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs). Seasonally  adjusted M2 is computed by summing savings deposits, small-denomination  time deposits, and retail MMMFs, each seasonally adjusted separately,  and adding this result to seasonally adjusted M1.\n\nM3 - Discontinuted\nFrom Investopidia\n\nM3 is a measure of the money supply that includes M2 as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements and larger liquid assets. The M3 measurement includes assets that are less liquid than other  components of the money supply and are referred to as ‚Äúnear, near  money,‚Äù which are more closely related to the finances of larger  financial institutions and corporations than to those of small  businesses and individuals\n\nM3 is no longer counted by the Federal Reserve. There are some private people who try to recreate a best guess of M3 such as John Williams from Shadow Stats. However the statistics they provide are best guess and should be viewd as a guide rather than relied upon as accurate.\nWhy is M2 important?\nSince M2 includes the money supply from M1, it is a great indicator of just how much inflation is injected directly into the economy. Inflations is defined as an increase in the money supply. By looking at M2, we can see just how much prices for goods and services will rise.\nFor instance, when the Federal Reserve through its Open Markets Operations (FOMO) and Open Markets Comitte (FOMC) bailed out Wall Steet and banks, they did so by injecting money into the M3 money supply. As such asset prices for Stocks and housing, which are largely dependent on credit, rose. However because that money did not come into the M2 supply goods and services remained relativly low (4.5% increase annually)\nNow is the time to pay close attention to M2. Understanding M2 will help you know where to put your money to keep it safe. Particularly if you do not have a lot of money, understaning M2 will let you know what you are going to need to buy excess of because the price of goods will increase in the future."},"media":{"title":"Media","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I recently had my first radio interview and I hope it is not the last.

I tend to like more modern Westerns like Young Guns (which is not on the list for some reason), Django Unchained, and Wyatt Earp. However there are some gems in the original Westerns so I am going to be watching them.\nGoing down the list I was surprised at just how many I had already watched.
