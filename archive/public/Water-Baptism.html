<p>Someone commented this on the post above:</p>
<p><code>Baptism Means nothing if He has not placed his faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ and repented of his sins. If he has, then praise God. I love Russell Brand, one of the smartest and funniest guys out there</code>.</p>
<p>Friend, you have this backwards.</p>
<p>James 2:14:
<em>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</em></p>
<p>James 2:15:
And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:
James 2:16:
And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?</p>
<p>James 2:17:
<strong>So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Bible believing Christian like me, then you have to realize that what our friend professed to believe is not what the Bible teaches.</p>
<p>And then there was this comment:</p>
<p><code>Water does not wash away our sins. the blood of Jesus alone does that.</code></p>
<p>And then later this:</p>
<p><code>I am a Bible believing Christian. If you say baptism can wash away sin then why would Almighty God send his Son to die? Please. You are taking scripture out of context. The thief on the cross was not baptized. I encourage baptism but to say it is necessary for salvation takes away from what Jesus did on the cross.</code></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take on the the first objection that water does not wash away our sins.</p>
<p><strong>Two requirements - REPENT &amp; BAPTISM</strong></p>
<p>Acts 2:38:
But Peter said to them: Do (<strong>REPENT</strong>) penance: and be (<strong>BAPTISM</strong>) baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Acts 8:26:
Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.
Acts 8:27:
And rising up, he went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.
Acts 8:28:
And he was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading Isaias the prophet.
Acts 8:29:
And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near and join thyself to this chariot.
Acts 8:30:
And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?
Acts 8:31:
Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
Acts 8:32:
And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter: and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.
Acts 8:33:
In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?
Acts 8:34:
And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? Of himself, or of some other man?</p>
<p><strong>WITNESS 1st</strong></p>
<p>Phillip tells the eunuch about Christ (from the Old Testament).</p>
<p>Acts 8:35:
<em>Then Philip, opening his mouth and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</em>
Acts 8:36:
And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said: See, here is water: <strong>What doth hinder me from being baptized?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Asks if he believes, 2nd</strong>
Acts 8:37:
And Philip said: <em><strong>If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest</strong></em>. And he answering, said: <em><strong>I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Water Baptism, 3rd</strong>
Acts 8:38:
And he commanded the chariot to stand still. <em><strong>And they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch. And he baptized him.</strong></em>
Acts 8:39:
And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip: and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
<p><strong>BAPTISM WASHES AWAY SIN</strong>
Acts 22:16:
And now why tarriest thou? Rise up and be baptized and <strong>wash away thy sins</strong>, invoking his name.</p>
<p>Acts shows us that there is more than one thing required for salvation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Witness and acceptance. Phillip witnesses to the eunuch. The eunuch hears and accepts.</li>
<li>The eunuch is Baptized.</li>
<li>Our sins are in fact washed away by baptism.</li>
</ol>
<p>What did not happen?</p>
<p>After the eunuch believed what Phillip witnessed to him, Phillip did not say ‚ÄúWell you are saved because you believed‚Äù. He also did not say ‚ÄúStop the chariot and pray the sinners prayer with me‚Äù.</p>
<p>There were two works that needed to be done. He had to believe and then be baptized. And note that Phillip put a qualifier on baptism. Phillip says ‚ÄúIF you believe with all your heart‚Äù, so baptism is conditional too. It‚Äôs not good enough to say you believe, you have to do so with all your heart.</p>
<p>Romans 6: 3 Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death?
4 <em><strong>For we are buried together with him by baptism into death:</strong></em> that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.</p>
<p>Take note that Paul doesn‚Äôt say, you are saved because you believe. He does however say explicitly that a work - baptism - is what causes us to have a new life.</p>
<p>You are positively not saved by faith alone and those espousing that are not Bible believing Christians because clearly the Bible does not teach that. Faith is a necessary requirement but is not the only requirement.</p>
<p><strong>The Thief on The Cross Objection</strong></p>
<p>If you are before Jesus and He forgives you, because He is God The Father, God The Son, and God The Holy Spirit, then there is nothing more needed. During the Mass we say ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.‚Äù Matthew 8:8 Christ has that power, no one else. So unless you were forgiven directly by Christ, you should get baptized with water.</p>
<p>Mark 16:15-16
15 And he said unto them,  Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
16 <strong>He that believeth <em>and is baptized</em> shall be saved</strong>; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xml:space="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
