Hey there, thanks for dropping in!

I know the site looks kind of ugly at the momemnt, but I am in the process of redesigning it from ground up. I use [Go Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site and unytill recently I was using the wonderful Hyde theme as the basis for the site. I guess I wanted to get to know Go Hugo more intimately so I decided to create my own theme from scratch. 

My focus is going to be mobile responsivness and a lean and clean code base. I long for the days of Internet 1.0, where the focus was on the content and not who was visiting the site or what ads you can server the visitor. So it is with that spirit that I am going for. I may even impement an HTML 4.0 blinking scroll :)

Stay tuned. 

Cappy
